Bugs
strand lengths don't update correctly unless you drag the grid

Feature Requests

half-cycle walkthrough like the original grid maker

when bights are close together labels can get jumbled
  - maybe some kind of font adjuster
  - maybe label every other bight

save settings to cookie
ability to rotate grid 90 degrees
auto rotate when wide grid


// Some of these have already been done
1.      Add a Checkbox to include/exclude knot data in printout. 
or, just include it in the printout without a checkbox
(Because I am editing crossings, I'm finding that I wish I could capture the knot data in my printout since I save them to PDF)

2.      Chosen colors are not appearing in the data section of the printout

3.      If the first half-cycle goes around the mandrel more than once, indicate how many times in the run list

A1 [around 2x] to B7

4.      In the instructions section (run list), when there is more than one strand, indicate the color assigned from the data section
e.g., Strand 1 [green]

5.      In the strand lengths section, convert strand length into feet and inches
easy but also a low priority since it doesn't match what I'm seeing

6.      In the strand lengths section, when there is more than one strand, indicate the color assigned from the data section

7.      When consolidating overs and unders . . .

a.      Have a space between consolidated unders and overs but NO space between consolidated overs and unders.

e.g., 
O1U1 O3U2 O2U2
U3 O2U1 O2U2

b.      When a pattern repeats, further consolidate it

e.g.,
O1U1 O1U1 O1U1 O2U1

becomes

O1U1 [3 times] O2U1
