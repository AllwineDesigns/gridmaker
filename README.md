gridmaker
=========

Allows you to design and provides instructions for tying Turk's head knots.

Setup
-----
If you have a web server running, you can check out this repository to the htdocs or html folder to serve up the 
javascript and html correctly. Then in a browser you can go to something like (depending on the port number you're
using, in this case :7777, if you're running on port 80 then you don't need that bit):

http://localhost:7777/gridmaker/index.html - takes you to the basic single strand grid maker
http://localhost:7777/gridmaker/advanced.html - takes you to the advanced multistranded grid maker
